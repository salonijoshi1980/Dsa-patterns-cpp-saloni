# 🧠 DSA Patterns in C++ – Saloni's Problem Solving Journey

Welcome to my **personal learning journey** through mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++ 🚀.  
This repository isn't just about solving problems — it's a space where I document my understanding, mistakes, breakthroughs, and patterns that shape my thinking, improving my **cognitive discipline**, and **stimulating my personality and mind**. It's about understanding the patterns behind them and shaping a sharp, logical mind.

I started this repository to keep myself accountable, record my progress, and grow every single day.


## ✨ Why I Built This Repo

I created this repository:
- To train my brain to think in patterns.
- To build a consistent **problem-solving mindset** 🧩
- To improve my logic, clarity, and consistency.
- To track what I’m learning daily and how I solved real problems(mean pattern-solving progress).
- To get better at **Competitive Programming** and **Future work**.
- To keep pushing even when things feel hard.
- To **understand core DSA patterns** deeply rather than rushing to "complete DSA".
- To **write, reflect, and improve** through code and notes.
- To keep a **public record of my growth** as a problem solver, not just a coder.

## 🗂️ What's Inside?

You'll find:
- 📚 **Pattern-based folders** like Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Binary Search, etc.
- 📝 Well-commented C++ solutions (brute + optimized when possible)
- 🌱 Rough notes and logs where I record how I felt, what I learned, and how I struggled

## 🔍 Patterns I'm Focusing On (6-Month Plan)

| Month | Pattern                          | Status   |
|-------|----------------------------------|----------|
| 1️⃣    | Sliding Window                   | ✅ In Progress |
| 1️⃣    | Two Pointers                     | ⏳ Starting Soon |
| 1️⃣    | Hashmaps / Prefix Sums           | 🔜 Queued |
| 1️⃣    | Binary Search                    | 🔜 Queued |
| 2️⃣    | Trees, Graphs (DFS/BFS)          | 🔒 Upcoming |
| 2️⃣    | Recursion + Backtracking         | 🔒 Upcoming |
| 2️⃣    | Heaps / Priority Queues          | 🔒 Upcoming |
| 3️⃣    | Dynamic Programming              | 🔒 Later |
| 3️⃣    | Union-Find (DSU)                 | 🔒 Later |

> Each pattern is explored through ~10–15 problems from LeetCode and Codeforces.

## 💭 My Belief

This repo is not about how fast I can finish DSA.  
It's about:
- Slowing down to think deeply
- Writing intentionally
- Solving with curiosity
- **Letting my silence speak** through code — just like WhisperBook

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Platforms

- Language: `C++`
- Platforms: [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com), [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com)

---

## 📖 How to Use This Repo (if you're a learner too)

1. Pick a pattern (e.g., Sliding Window)
2. Open the folder and read comments + solution
3. Try solving first by yourself (I started with brute force!)
4. Reflect — what confused you? what clicked?

---

## 🌟 Motivation

I believe DSA isn't just for job interviews —  
It's for **training your mind**, for **becoming sharp**, and for **building discipline** when life feels chaotic.
